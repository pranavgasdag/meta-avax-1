# ERC20 and Vault Contracts - README

## Overview

This project consists of two primary Solidity contracts:

1. **ERC20 Token Contract**: A standard implementation of the ERC20 token standard.
2. **Vault Contract**: A contract designed to securely store and manage ERC20 tokens.

## ERC20 Token Contract

### Features

- **Standard ERC20 Functions**: `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`.
- **Minting and Burning**: Functions to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens.
- **Events**: Emits `Transfer` and `Approval` events as per the ERC20 standard.

### Deployment

1. Set up a Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat).
2. Compile the ERC20 token contract.
3. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network.
4. Record the deployed contract address for future interactions.

### Example Usage

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ERC20Token.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20Token {
    constructor() ERC20Token("MyToken", "MTK", 18, 1000000) {
        // Initial minting or additional setup
    }
}
```

## Vault Contract

### Features

- **Deposit and Withdraw**: Allows users to deposit and withdraw ERC20 tokens.
- **Balance Tracking**: Keeps track of each user's deposited token balance.
- **Access Control**: Ensures only authorized actions can be performed by specific addresses.

### Deployment

1. Set up a Solidity development environment.
2. Compile the Vault contract.
3. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network.
4. Set the ERC20 token contract address in the Vault contract after deployment.

### Example Usage

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Vault.sol";

contract MyVault is Vault {
    constructor(address _tokenAddress) Vault(_tokenAddress) {
        // Additional setup if needed
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
- Node.js and npm (for Truffle or Hardhat setups)
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with testnet/mainnet ETH

## Interacting with the Contracts

### ERC20 Token Contract

- **Mint Tokens**: Only callable by the owner.
- **Burn Tokens**: Callable by any user with a sufficient balance.
- **Transfer Tokens**: Transfer tokens to another address.

### Vault Contract

- **Deposit Tokens**: Deposit a specified amount of ERC20 tokens.
- **Withdraw Tokens**: Withdraw a specified amount of ERC20 tokens.

### Example Interactions

#### Minting Tokens (ERC20)

```solidity
await erc20Token.mint("0xYourAddress", 1000);
```

#### Depositing Tokens (Vault)

```solidity
await erc20Token.approve(vaultAddress, 500);
await vault.deposit(500);
```

#### Withdrawing Tokens (Vault)

```solidity
await vault.withdraw(200);
```

## Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized addresses can mint and burn tokens.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test the contracts on a testnet before deploying to mainnet.
- **Audits**: Consider having the contracts audited by a third-party security firm.
